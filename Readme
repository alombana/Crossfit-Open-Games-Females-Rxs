Project One - Crossfit Open games from 2021 to 2023

This data is about the open exercises that participants need to achieve to submit their results and see if they can make it to the next stage until got a place in the 40 best participants in the world that can participate in the final.

I decided to use three years of data for the last opens (2021, 2022, and 2023) to count with more information for the changes in the ages, weight, and height of the competitors. 
	Good points: 
	1. Because you have to subscribe to the CrossFit games and update your results in the platform to get your position. So the major part of the data related to the scores is there.
	2. The use of API and not authorization was needed so it was easy to get the information from it
	3. how the leaderboard is structured was the same for the years analyzed, with only the amount of workout changes in 2022 (only 3 WOD), so the def function for creating the lists works for all of them, perfectly.
	4. I always could validate with the website if the information that at the end I got in the DataFrame was the same that they have there.

	Negative points:

	1. Basic information about the competitors, country, weight, and height, is not there, because it is not mandatory to enter at the moment of registration
	2. There are a lot of participants which of course is good, but in the end, the JSON files are huge, so approximately 15 to 20 min are needed to get the data for each year.

	Main challenges:
	1. Understanding all the nested information gotten from the URL to create a def function that helps me with the years.
	2. Applying all the knowledge acquired in the lessons. It is quite different when you do it yourself.
	3. Time. I want to search for more data that help me with the missing information on the competitors' basic information.

I decided to choose this data for the following hypothesis that most people have:
	-Is age a factor for being in the best of the opens?
	-Is the weight and height a factor for being in the best of the opens?
	-Is there a significant difference between the best competitors for the analyzed opens?

I decided to use three years of data for the last opens (2021, 2022, and 2023) to have more information on the changes in the ages, weight, and height of the competitors. 

Methodology:
For getting the data:
1. I decided to use request URL - API because the dataframe that I founded where only for one year and it does not contain all the information of each WOD and the competitors. 
2. I started to create a def function that helped me to create a list of the information that I needed. So I was using a lot of "for .. in ..." "type()" with a few pages to understand how nested the data was. 
3. At the end got several lists for each year that I concat for getting one DataFrame with all the information. In the Jupyter Notebook, I have to create also a "while loop" for the pagination. To this, I added the "print()" to control if it was running and not stuck. Something that I did not do for 2023 because I realized when it was running.

Here is the explanation of each list:
	-rank: The position that the competitor got at the end of the open
	-points: The sum of the position got for each exercise done (Therefore if you have 	the least points it means that it is better)
	-competitors_infor= All the basic information about each competitor (country, age, weight, continent...)
	-Exerc1, Exerc2, Exerc3, Exerc4: The exercise with the results of each participant, also with some more information such as the judges' name and affiliations credentials

For cleaning:
1. I opened each data frame and decided to only get the first 1.000 following the rank for each year. Therefore I passed from around 6 thousand rows to 3 thousand rows. I decided to drop the rest because, in the end, only 40 participants go to the games, therefore I believe that analyzing around 2000 for each year gives enough range.


Notes: The information was gotten through the API. No passwords are required for it. You can find the URL for each year in the folder named data/original_data. Keep in mind that the page starts always in one. You will need to iterate between the pagination. That code could be found in the file saved in the notebooks.

For more information about the URL-API you can inspect the website, go to Network, and search by competition, there you will find the leaderboards and in Headers the Request URL.
